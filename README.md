# XIV Money Tracker 
A tool to track your money earned and spent in ffxiv.

## Warning!
I created this plugin for personal use, because I wanted to know my profits and expenses while crafting and gathering in ffxiv. It never was intended as a public plugin, so don't _**expect**_ any help or assistance if something doesn't work. But since quite a few people have since found their way to this plugin somehow, I figured I might as well write a readme.

## Installation guide
The installation guide can be found over on the page of my main repository:
